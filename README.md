Real-Time Sign Language Detection with Python
This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam. Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras, 
the system processes video input frame-by-frame, detects hand gestures, and classifies them into corresponding sign language letters or words. The goal is to improve accessibility and 
communication for the hearing-impaired community by providing a fast, intuitive interface for sign language interpretation.
